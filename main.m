%% Building your rocket %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % INTAB = intab_builder(rocket parts);
    % The inputs are the rocket parts, as described below
    % The output is the rocket data on the INTAB format

    %% Motor
        % Motor = {'motor', 'Name', Ttable, length, diameter, position}
        % Ttable = {time,thrust,mass}
        % 'position' should be 0 when developing a new motor, as it will be
        % replaced on the intab_builder function. It represents the distance
        % between the foremost point of the rocket and the motor position.
        % import_eng is a custom script that imports data from a .eng file 
        % to the motor variable. The .eng motor file should be contained in
        % the same directory from which the simulation is being run.

    %% Nose cone
        % Nose = {'nose', type, length, diameter, mass, position}
        % type can be 'ogive', 'conical' or 'parabolic'
        % type = 'von karman' is also possible, due to an customized ad-on to 
        % to the function Barrowman_calc.m (works when using the customized
        % 'Functions' directory).
        % position for the nose cone should be zero. position always means
        % distance relative to the rocket's nose tip.

    %% Cylinder
        % Cil = {'cylinder', surface, length, diameter, mass, position}
        % 'surface' is 'yes' if it forms part of the rocket's body
        % aerodynamic surface, or 'no' if it does not.

    %% Tube
        % T = {'tube', surface, length, inner diameter,
        %       outer diameter, mass, position}

    %% Conical transition

    %% Point mass
        % PM = {'pm', mass, r_position, l_position}
        % r_position is the radial position from the center axis
        % l_position is the longitudinal position from the nose tip

    %% Fins set
        % FS = {'finset', number of fins, root chord, tip chord, sweep length,
        %       span, thickness, mass, body diameter at fin, 
        %       maximum body diameter, position}

    %% Parachute
        % P = {'parachute', Cd, area, mass, position}    
        % If dual deploy is used, drogue must be before main

        % landa = [length, area]; Rocket data
        % paratab = [Cd, area];  Parachute data


%% Customized Atmosphere with Interspersed Oscilations (CAIO_atmosphere)
    % The custom atmosphere model implemented here is based on a (very
    % crude) logarithm velocity distribution, with additional pertubations
    % being accounted for via randomized scalars applied to the relevant
    % atmospheric variables.
    
    %% Altitude vector
        % altitude = [lb_h : step_h : max_h]
        % lb_h is the launch base height (must be =/= 0)
        % step_h is the incremente in height
        % max_h is the maximum height (must be higher the the expected
        % apogee).
        
    %% INMET DATA
        % http://www.inmet.gov.br/portal/index.php?r=estacoes/estacoesAutomaticas
        % is a repository of historic meteorological data.
        % Given a launch site and a launch window, a sample of the relevant
        % atmospheric data should be taken for the closest meteorological
        % station to the launch site, using the past year's data for the
        % same dates determined by the launch window.
    
        % avg_wind_direction is the average (for all measurements within
        % the launch window) of the wind direction (relative to true
        % north) (INMET: Vento -> Dir.).
        
        % avg_temperature is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the ground wind's mean temperature. (INMET:
        % Temperatura -> 0.5*(Min+Max)).
        
        % avg_windspeed is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the mean wind velocity (INMET: Vento -> Vel.).
        
        % avg_windshear is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the shear wind velocity (INMET: Vento -> Raj.).
 
    %% Reference Parameters
        % Parameters for the logarithm model of the atmosphere.
        
        % ref_height is the reference height at which ground velocity data
        % is know. Must be =/= 0, tipically 2m for INMET data.
        
        % ref_roughness is the friction coefficient between ground and
        % atmosphere. Typical value is ~0.1.
        % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roughness_length
        
    
    %% Random Parameters
        % Parameters for the randomization of the atmospheric profiles.
        
        % rand_temperature is the maximum percentual variation allowed for
        % in the temperature value. The final temperature profile will
        % oscilate from it's average value randomly by this % factor.
        
        % rand_velocity is the maximum percentual variation allowed for in
        % the wind velocity profile.
        
        % rand_direction is the maximum dregrees (from true north)
        % variation allowed for in the wind direction profile.
